--- TO DO ---
Simple list of things we need to do.

--- ScriptDev2 Framework ---

- Write a "OnDeath" function and get it patched into mangos core
- New function to spawn mobs from within scriptdev
- Fix item scripts
- Remove Honor vendor scripts since they are useless

--- Scripting with Priorities ---
1) Boss AI scripts
2) Specific NPC scripts
3) Event scripts
4) Spell and Item scripts

--- Core Problems ---

- No "OnDeath" function
- Unable to spawn from within scriptdev (possible fix in Mangoscript but needs to be applied to core)
- Unable to create new movement generators (you shouldn't need to though)
- Item scripts arn't implemented in the core
- Spell scripts arn't implemented in the core
- Events/EventScripts don't even truely exist in the core yet
