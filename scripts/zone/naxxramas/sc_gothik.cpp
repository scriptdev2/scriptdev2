//Gothik
//8806 spch - Foolishly you have sought your own demise. Brazenly you have disregarded powers beyond your understanding. You have fought hard to invade the realm of the harvester. Now there is only one way out - to walk the lonely path of the damned.
//8808 tlpt - I have waited long enough! Now, you face the harvester of souls!
//8806 slay - Death is the only escape.
//8805 death - I... am... undone!
